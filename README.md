# C GameDev (just for fun)

This is something I like to play with when I am bored, nothing serious here.

## Compile and run

Windows and MINGW32/MSYS assumed.

```
chmod +x deps.sh
make deps       # download dependencies, see deps.sh for details
make all        # make executable
make SDL2.dll   # copy SDL2.dll from 3rdparty bin dir

./main.exe      # run app
```
